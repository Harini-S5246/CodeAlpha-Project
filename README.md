Welcome to my Data Science internship project with **CodeAlpha**. This project showcases the end-to-end data analysis pipeline — from raw data to insightful visualizations and machine learning model evaluation.

This notebook serves as a demonstration of my learning journey, hands-on skills, and practical application of data science techniques, executed during a one-month internship.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset was first explored using various techniques:

- Distribution plots (histograms)
- KDE plots for class separability
- Pairplots and scatter plots for visual correlation
- Heatmaps to visualize feature correlation

> *You can add actual plots by exporting them from your notebook and saving in an `/assets` folder.*

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Implemented multiple classification algorithms to evaluate which gives the best performance:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** *(if used)*
- **Decision Trees / Random Forest** *(if applicable)*

Each model was trained and tested using a split of the dataset with `train_test_split`.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of each model:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Visualization of predictions and errors

Sample confusion matrix:

```text
[[13  0  0]
 [ 0 12  1]
 [ 0  1 13]]
